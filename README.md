# Review-Fusion
Review-Fusion is a full stack web app that aggregates review sources from multiple sources. The frontend uses react, NodeJS on the backend, and MongoDB for the database. As of right now, it currently pulls data from Google, Yelp, and Tripadvisor. This web app heavily utilizes Yelp Fusion API to get restaurant data and the reviews were web scraped using cheerio and puppeteer.
